# Given two strings s and t, return true if the two strings 
# are anagrams of each other, otherwise return false.

# An anagram is a string that contains the exact same characters as 
# another string, but the order of the characters can be different.


# Example 1:

# Input: s = "racecar", t = "carrace"

# Output: true

# Solution 1 


def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if len(s) != len(t): 
            return False 

        return sorted(s) == sorted(t)

print (isAnagram("racecar", "carrace"))
